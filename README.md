⚙️ Technologies Used:

.NET 8 Web API

Apache Kafka

Docker & Docker Compose

Swagger for testing

Visual Studio 2022

📌 Key Learnings:

How to produce/consume Kafka events in .NET

Decoupling services with Kafka (loosely coupled architecture)

Building scalable, real-time communication between services

💡 Next Step: I plan to expand this into a Ride Booking scenario where RideService will publish events to Kafka, and services like Billing, Tracking, and Notification will handle them separately.

🔗 [Optional: Add your GitHub repo link here]

Would love to connect with others working on microservices or Kafka-based solutions! 😊
